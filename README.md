# Metis_Project
This is my first data_analysis project with Metis Intro to data analysis class. 
In this project, I am using the crime rate public data provided by the city of oakland provide by the city of oakland.
I will compare diffrnet type of the crime across Oakland neighborhood and given time and location, I will 
predict the category of crime that occurred.
